The threads produce diffrent end resultd for x, depening on the order that the operations are executed across the threads.
x = x+1 can be split into three instructions, which can be represented as follows:
 temp = x			read
 temp = x + 1,			add
 x = temp			write
			
Lowest Value of X = 2

Thread 1		Thread 2		Thread 3
read			
			read
			add
			write
			read
			add
			write
add
write
			read

Highest Value of X = 9
