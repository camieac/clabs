# Exercises

1. Write a function node `*append(node *x, node *y)` that
appends the elements of the the second list y to the end of the
first list x (i.e. append([1,2],[3,4]) ==> [1,2,3,4]).

  How does this affect the list x?

2. Write a second version that does not modify the input lists.

  Under which condition is it safe to use the first version?

3. Write a function node `*reverse(node *x)` that reverses the
elements in the list (i.e. reverse([1,2,3]) ==> [3,2,1])
