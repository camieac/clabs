2. Write a function struct node `*readTree(FILE *fin, int n)` that reads n integer values from a file and builds a balanced tree.

3. Write a function void `insert(struct node *t, int n)` that inserts a value n into a tree, whose leaves are sorted in ascending order.

4. For an input array of length n, how much space does such a tree consume?
Change the tree data structure, to use a more efficient representation of the tag.
